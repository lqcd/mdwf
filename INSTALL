A quick way to build and intall MDWF is to unpack the sources (which you have
probably already done as you are reading this file), create a build directory,
and run configure and make. E.g., 

$ bunzip < mdwf-X.X.X.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../mdwf-X.X.X/configure --target=bluelight --prefix=$HOME
$ make
$ make install

Though the configure script is hand written, I tried to follow general
principles of GNU configures. Because the script is short, I hope one can grasp
what's going by looking into it.

In the ./config/ there are two kinds of files: (a) host.xxx are parts of
the configuration process specific for build hosts, and (b) target.yyy contain
definitions for corresponding targets.
