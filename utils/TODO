Next big version:
[done] - make surface syntax for repeats identical on the top and
         lexical levels.
[done] more uniform macro substitution.
[done] add macros on the top level with arguments and register renaming.
- backport improvements from BGL/XLC to C99.
- make loads and stores return computed address (optional, so the current syntax
  still works).
