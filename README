This is a SciDAC L3 Moebius domain wall fermion implementation. It targets
the following backends:

c99       -- any conforming C99 compiler
altivec   -- PPC multimedia extension
sse       -- x86 SSE/SSE2 instruction set
bluelight -- IBM BlueGene/L Double Hummer floating point unit.

For details on building the package see INSTALL in this directory.

For hints about integration into higher level LQCD codes, see the samples/ tree.

If you are interested in porting to other backends, read the sources and talk
to me once you understand the structure of the code.
