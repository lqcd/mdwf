Init:
1. allocate one QMP aligned memory block for all sends and receives on
   max(even, odd), assuming double.
2. On even and odd:
  2.1 Head of memory - receive buffer.
  2.2 build pointers to send buffers.
  2.3 Build all float & double sends
  2.4 Build all float and double receive, convert to compounds.
3. Check that global sum should be called -- ?

Fini:
1. For even and odd
  1.1 Free receive handle
  1.2 Free all send handles
2. Free QMP memory

Allocation:
1. If error is not recordable return
2. Allocate
3. Increase state counter

Freeing:
1. If error is not recordable return
2. Decrease state counter
3. Free memory

Setting parameters
1. If error is not recordable return
2. Allocate memory for generics
3. Build generic parameters
4. Call generics
5. Free memory
